# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Austyn Nguyen!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science major at the University of Michigan â€“ Ann Arbor, where Iâ€™m exploring everything from systems programming and machine learning to human-computer interaction and finance. Iâ€™m passionate about building technologies that are intelligent, user-centered, and globally respectful.

## ðŸ“˜ About Me

I'm a curious technologist who enjoys the intersection of hardware and software, especially when it helps solve real-world problems. From prototyping a voice-controlled home assistant wristband to developing data pipelines for clinical research, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to build practical, high-impact solutions.

Iâ€™m also fascinated by how culture and context shape the way we design and interact with technology. With roots in Vietnamese traditions and a strong interest in international collaboration, I hope to bridge technical innovation with cultural empathy.

## ðŸŽ» Music Background

I started playing viola in 5th grade and never stopped. Over the years, music became both a creative outlet and a discipline that shaped how I approach problem-solving and collaboration.

Now entering my **second year of college**, I still play regularly and continue to refine my technique and expression through formal private lessons with SMTD faculty and the Michigan Pops Orchestra. I also had the privilege of studying under **Kenneth Goldstein** of the **Baltimore Symphony Orchestra** for three years prior to coming to university, whose guidance was instrumental in my growth as a musician.
