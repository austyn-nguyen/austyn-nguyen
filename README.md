# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Austyn Nguyen

I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Michigan â€“ Ann Arbor with interests in Entreprenuership, Business, and Economics. I earned two Associateâ€™s degrees before finishing high school at Howard Community College, and Iâ€™m on track to finish my bachelorâ€™s in 3 years. Iâ€™m currently studying abroad at Yonsei University in Seoul to explore how culture influences techâ€”from digital infrastructure to how people interact with machines.

As a first-generation college student and a proud Vietnamese American, I care about making technology thatâ€™s respectful, accessible, and human. My cultural valuesâ€”especially filial pietyâ€”taught me the importance of empathy and responsibility, which I try to reflect in everything I build.

Beyond code, Iâ€™m a classically trained violist who believes that creativity and structure go hand in hand. Whether Iâ€™m playing chamber music or debugging software, Iâ€™m drawn to patterns and people.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been curious about how different countriesâ€”like South Koreaâ€”approach urban design, esports, privacy, and public tech. Why doesnâ€™t Korea use Google Maps? Why do social robots feel more common here than in the U.S.? Iâ€™m here to learn, ask questions, and build with intention.

Thanks for stopping by!
